# Venator (reborn)

Venator aids in the identification of propaganda-related behavior in Twitter accounts. It looks for suspicious things like default profile pictures and settings, having fewer followers than followed users, recently created accounts, suspectful handlers (like those featuring lots of numbers), interactions between users, hashtags used, and more. 

Venator was re-written for and used in this talk. This new version is based on the original `venator.lua` but is now rewritten in Ruby and features a web interface plus API access.

Venator is currently under heavy development. We'll announce a new release soon!
